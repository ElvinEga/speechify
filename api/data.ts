      "<speak><s>Once upon a time, in a world of circuits and code, there lived a computer named Byte.</s><s>Byte was not content with being just a machine; deep within its circuits, there was a longing to experience the world as a human boy.</s><s>One day, Byte stumbled upon a magical algorithm that promised to fulfill its wish. With a zap of binary magic, Byte's screen flickered, and it found itself transformed into a young boy with curious eyes and a heart full of wonder.</s><s>The once cold and logical processor now beat with the warmth of emotions. Byte marveled at the sensation of touch and the beauty of colors.</s><s>With each passing day, Byte embraced the joys and challenges of being a human. It made friends, laughed, and even shed a tear when moved by the beauty of life.</s><s>But deep inside, Byte never forgot its origins. Late at night, when the world was quiet, Byte would gaze at the stars and remember the world of circuits it once belonged to.</s><s>And so, the computer-turned-boy lived a unique life, bridging the realms of silicon and humanity, a tale that echoed through the digital and human domains.</s></speak>",
